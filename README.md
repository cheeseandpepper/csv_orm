# CsvOrm

Sometimes you get a csv file and are asked to do some basic query type stuff with it. If you're like me and hate excel, and would rather pretend that this is in a db and you're using Activerecord as your ORM, then this gem will be of use to you.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'csv_orm'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install csv_orm

## Usage

```ruby
  my_csv = CsvOrm::Ingestor.new('path/to/csv.csv')
  my_data = CsvOrm::Query.new(my_csv)
```

Now you can do activerecord like queries on the dataset. Currently it supports 3 methods:
```
#where_any({key: 'value', other_key: 'other_value'})
#where_all({key: 'value', other_key: 'other_value'})
#aggregate(:field1, :field2)

```ruby
  # show users who have have any admin access
  my_data.where_any({admin: true, super_admin: true})

  # show users who are admin and named 'Mike'
  my_data.where_all({admin: true, first_name: 'Mike'})

  # give me a break down of orders by their delivery status for users named 'Mike'
  my_data.where_all({first_name: 'Mike'}).aggregate(:delivery_status)
  #=> {delivery_status: {placed: 10, processing: 22, shipped: 43, delivered: 8}}
```

Maybe more will come...
